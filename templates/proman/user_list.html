        <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
        <p>The above report gives you access to several pieces of information alongside other relevant metrics. You can <strong>sort</strong> the individual columns to make comparisons. Here are some explanations of the fields and how you can use them to get more out your team.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Person</strong> - this is the person whom all of the projects or tasks are assigned. People who assign all of their tasks out may have low numbers on this chart as it doesn't measure Tasks in that way.</li>
            <li><strong>Projects</strong> - this is a count of all the projects someone currently has assigned to them. As this number grows, stress from communication comes into play.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
            <h3>Task Counts</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>All Tasks</strong> - the full count of open items on someone's plate. The may not be large or necessarily be due soon.</li>
            <li><strong>Due Tasks</strong> - this is the number of tasks due <strong>this week</strong>. This number does not change as items are marked done. It only changes it deadlines are changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Done Tasks</strong> - this is the number of tasks completed so far <strong>this week</strong>. In general it should be low on Monday and higher on Friday.</li>
            <li><strong>Avg Tasks</strong> - this is the average number of tasks someone has closed <strong>per week over the last 3 weeks</strong>. It should not fluctuate in the short term, but may grow in the longer term.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
            <h3>Task Hours</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>All Task Hours</strong> - the full measure of the time of open items on someone's plate. With good estimates, this is good measure of how much someone has on their plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Due Task Hours</strong> - this is how many hours of tasks are due <strong>this week</strong>. This number does not change as items are marked done. It only changes it deadlines or hour estimates are changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Done Task Hours</strong> - this is the number of hours of tasks completed so far <strong>this week</strong>. In general it should be low on Monday and higher on Friday.</li>
            <li><strong>Avg Task Hourss</strong> - this is the average hourly measure of tasks someone has closed <strong>per week over the last 3 weeks</strong>. It should not fluctuate in the short term, but may grow in the longer term.</li>
